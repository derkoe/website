summary: Investigating the internationalization features of Quarkus, especially translation.

[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) is a new promising Java web framework specifically designed for a cloud-native and microservices world.

I've been following the project for nearly two years now, and Quarkus is getting better and more complete with each release. On the other hand, there are still some features missing (at least in the docs).

I wanted to investigate the current state of internationalization (i18n) features of Quarkus, especially translation.

## Looking For Docs

There is no specific [Quarkus Guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/) for i18n, localization, or translation, but the Qute template engine contains some hints for translation:  [type-safe message bundles](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#type-safe-message-bundles).

Quarkus builds on top of the [Microprofile APIs](https://microprofile.io/). So, I have searched for i18n in Microprofile but could not find any specifics. It seems that most projects simply use Java's `PropertyResourceBundle`.

I am used to Spring (Boot) which has a specific abstraction for translation: [MessageSource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.x/reference/html/features.html#features.internationalization) which also provides caching and other additional features.
